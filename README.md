## Introduction

The purpose of this app is to act as a proof of concept (POC) for future reference on how the web applications can be built

The app is meant to showcase and implement the various frameworks and plugins that web applications can be built upon

### Basic concepts of web applications

The today web applications have several main components

1. Front end framework : This is the JS engine that helps manipulate the DOM (think of this as the visual part of the web. HTML part). This renders the visual components, handles business logic among many more functions
2. JS Bundler : This is the compiler for the app. Its responsible for compiling javascript and typescript code into js bundles that the normal browser can make sense of / execute

## Front end framework

Front end framework is a combination of two separate words, Front end + Framework. Front end is the visual site of any web application or a website, it is that part of the website with which a user interacts, and a framework in literal sense means an essential supporting structure of an object, the object is a website in this case.

Formally, a Framework is a platform for developing applications which provides a foundation on which software applications can be build.

So front end frameworks are the software packages that provide pre-written/reusable code modules and standardized front end technologies and ready made interface blocks making the process of front end development a lot more faster and simple.

## Framework of choice

### React

#### Why React?

Developed and maintained by Facebook, React is one of the best open source frameworks today. It has a larger developer support, highest adoption rate among web application projects.

React is the best option for complex projects that includes a number of blocks or components that goes through several possible states.

### Who uses React?

Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, UberEats and many other popular websites uses React in the production

## Honorable mention

### Angular

It is a Typescript-based development platform developed by Google. Angular is a component-based framework for developing scalable web applications, as well as a set of tools for developers to use to create, build, test, and modify code, and a collection of well-integrated libraries
